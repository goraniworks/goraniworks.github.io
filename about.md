Gorani Works is a developer based in GJ, South Korea. 

He focuses on the integration of hardware and software, with his ultimate goals being robotics and rocketry.

A 40-year-old man who has not yet settled down is still persisting with his project. 

If you think it's pitiable, send food as aid.



**My life goal**

```python
def life_goal(current_assets):
    if current_assets >= 100_000_000_000:
        return "Develop a rocket"
    elif current_assets >= 10_000_000_000:
        return "Develop a robot"
    elif current_assets >= 1_000_000_000:
        return "Develop a game"
    elif current_assets >= 500_000_000:
        return "Open a technical school in India"
    else:
        return "Work hard to save money"

# Enter current assets
current_assets = 0  # You can change the assets here to test.
goal = life_goal(current_assets)
print(goal)
```
